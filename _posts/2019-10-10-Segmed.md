A project emerged within the Chemical, Electric, and Biomedical Engineering Department of the Science and Engineering Division (DCI)of the University of Guanajuato . The purpose of it was developing a Deep Learning repository for Semantic Segmentation of Biomedical Images. Being part of the first group of undergraduate students who worked on this project, my work mainly focused on developing a logging system that could automatically register hardware specs at model instantiation time as well as every function call, notes, etc.

You are more than kindly invited to use this system if you think it could help you in your work. It is hosted [here](https://github.com/gmagannaDevelop/segnet/blob/callback_test/segnet/utils/Segmed.py). You can find a pdf manual of it (_in Spanish_) [here]({{ '/assets/docs/Segmed_Class_Example.pdf' | relative_url }} ).


You might have to install the whole repository, as a package via ```pip```. Further instructions are found on the REAMDE.md you will find when you follow the link to the hosting site (GitHub).
