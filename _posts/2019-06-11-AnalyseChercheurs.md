During my year at Mons, Belgium I followed many courses at the Polytechnic Faculty of the University of Mons. I decided however to take a course in Multidimensional Statistics, to learn techniques that could help me afterwards in my biomedical projects. I had this idea since I first took the Biostatistics course at León, Mexico.

We did a project analysing the temporal profile of research in diverse regions of France. We had to investigate if this profile was characterised by a certain profile, or was it time-dependent. 

We performed correlation analysis and PCA, among some other techniques. The original report (_in French_) can be found [here]({{ 'assets/docs/Rapport_Stat_Multidim.pdf' | relative_url }}).
