During my exchange I needed a way to effectively collect data for my _Projet d'Ingénierie Informatique_ at the [Faculté Polytechnique](https://web.umons.ac.be/fpms/fr/). For this purpose I decided to develop an App consisting of various scripts and UI files.

Creating it I explored the use of [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) and subsecuently the [JSON-Lines](http://jsonlines.org/) format. These seemed a good choice for my App's logs as the data is heterogeneous and a CSV file full of null entries would have been sub-optimal to say the least.

This "App"
