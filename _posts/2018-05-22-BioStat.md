During my formation as a biomedical engineer, I took a biostatistics course. 
We discussed most classical techniques used for univariate statistics. The course had of course a biomedical focus. The data we analysed was of biological or directly medical nature. 
We estimated distributions for variables measured in diverse ways. 
We performed normality tests, hypothesis tests, etc.

We even did example PCAs. This course really caught my attention. For this reason I decided to do a significant final project. I am a type 1 diabetes mellitus patient since I was one year old. 
I have always worked with biomedical data.
My understanding of the physiopathology was good but I had not 
yet applied any of the techniques I had learned during 
my undergraduate formation to improve my glycaemic control. 
This seemed like an optimal opportunity to start.

I had recently started using a [GCM](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/guide/continuous-glucose-monitoring) system. Abott Laboratories' _FreeStyle Libre_. Many patients see in CGM a possibility of leaving behind standard glucometers, because nobody likes to puncture their fingers. I had the same hope but found out that this was not a good idea, thanks to the statistical analysis I did of paired measurements.

I collected data during two weeks which was the duration of a _FreeStyle Libre_ sensor. Each time I measured my glycaemia with my glucometer I noted the value obtained with the sensor. Arfetwards I performed a series of statistical tests, and ended up reject the null hypothesis that the two distributions where undistinguishable. The full report (_in Spanish_) is available [here]({{ 'assets/docs/biostat.pdf' |  relative_url }})
