Born and raised in Guadalajara, Jalisco, México. Currently based in León, Guanajuato. 
I am a Biomedical Engineer, most representatively characterised by my curiosity. 
I love learning new things, be it languages, mathematics, programming or about anything. 
I picked my major because I wanted to partake 
in medical research but my favourite subject was always math. 
More than merely help to cure patients, I want my work to help improve the quality of life
of chronically ill people like me (I have type 1 diabetes mellitus).

My main interests going into college were math and biology. 
I had no idea that Computer Science would become such a central topic of interest for me.
At the Science and Engineering Division of the University of Guanajuato I had the privilege 
of working with talented and discilplined scientists who reshaped my vision of a professional
career. I was also blessed to encounter friends with an unquenchable intellectual appetite.
Together we learnt to program, beyond our programmes' scopes.

I studied abroad in Belgium for a whole academic year. My main a priori motivation 
was predominantly linguistic. Nevertheless, shortly after arriving to the city of Mons 
I found out that the year I had ahead of me was going to trascend 
my expectations in ways I could have not imagined. During that year I could mature and enlarge
my software developing skills, creating applications that would help me change the way I manage
my diabetes' therapy. Certainly what I least expected was to find the love of my life during 
the second semester of my exchange but these are the kind of things that we cannot control.

I am currently working on a project to further consolidate my expertise in time series 
processing techniques. The ultimate goal is to produce a set of high-quality literate 
and polyglot programming documents. These will serve as an educational asset freely 
available to the public and will set the foundation for futher research on glycaemic behaviour
analysis. <b> The organisation's repository: </b>
