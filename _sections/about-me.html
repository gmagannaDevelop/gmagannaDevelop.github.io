<p>
Born and raised in Guadalajara, Jalisco, México. Currently based at León, Guanajuato. 
I am a Biomedical Engineer, most representatively characterised by his curiosity. 
I love learning new things, be it languages, math, programming. I picked up my major because 
I wanted to partake in medical research but my favourite subject was always math. 
More than merely help "curing" patients, I want my work to help improve the quality of life
of chronically ill people like me (I have type 1 diabetes mellitus).

My main interests going into college were math and biology. 
I had no idea that Computer Science would become such a central topic of interest for me.
At the Science and Engineering Division of the University of Guanajuato I had the privilege 
of working with talented and discilplined scientist who reshaped my vision of a professional
career. I was also blessed with encountering friends with an unquenchable intellectual appetite.
Together we learnt to program, beyond our programmes' scopes.
