# Developer @ [DCI-NET](https://github.com/DCI-NET)
A project emerged within the [Chemical, Electric, and Biomedical Engineering Department](http://www.dci.ugto.mx/diqeb/) of the Science and Engineering Division of the [University of Guanajuato](https://www.ugto.mx/). The purpose of it was developing a Deep Learning repository for Semantic Segmentation of Biomedical Images. Being part of the first group of undergraduate students who worked on this project, my work mainly focused on the following tasks:

1. Revision of *l'Ã©tat de l'art*, finding the [MultiResUNet architecture](https://github.com/nibtehaz/MultiResUNet).
2. [Reimplementation](https://github.com/gmagannaDevelop/MyMultiResUNet) of said architecture.
3. Training and testing the repository using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). 


You can find a pdf manual of the logging system I developed [here](/assets/docs/Segmed_Class_Example.pdf)
