# Developer @ [DCI-NET](https://github.com/DCI-NET)
A project emerged within the [Chemical, Electric, and Biomedical Engineering Department](http://www.dci.ugto.mx/diqeb/) of the Science and Engineering Division of the [University of Guanajuato](https://www.ugto.mx/). The purpose of it was developing a Deep Learning repository for Semantic Segmentation of Biomedical Images. Being part of the first group of undergraduate students who worked on this project, my work mainly focused on the following tasks:

1. Revision of *l'Ã©tat de l'art*, finding the [MultiResUNet architecture](https://github.com/nibtehaz/MultiResUNet).
2. [Reimplementation](https://github.com/gmagannaDevelop/MyMultiResUNet) of said architecture.
3. Training and testing the repository's models using [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). 

It is to be noted however, that very rapidly I found out the complications of training and testig Deep Learning models. For this reason the main focus of my work shifted towrads developing a logging system that could automatically register  hardware specs at model instantiation time as well as every function calls, notes, etc.

The system I developed is hosted [here](https://github.com/gmagannaDevelop/segnet/blob/callback_test/segnet/utils/Segmed.py). You can find a pdf manual of it [here](/assets/docs/Segmed_Class_Example.pdf).
