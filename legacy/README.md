# Credits

Thanks to [@chrisbobbe](https://github.com/chrisbobbe) for the marvellous work done creating this theme.

I'm actually using a slightly modified version of it, found on [my fork](https://github.com/gmagannaDevelop/jekyll-theme-prologue).

Thanks to @andrewbanchich for his many Jekyll adaptations of HTML5 UP's elegant themes, which helped and inspired me, and of course many thanks to HTML5 UP.
